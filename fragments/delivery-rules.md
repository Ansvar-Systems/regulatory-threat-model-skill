## Deliver the report

`generate_report(workflow_id, format=…)` returns the typed report and, beside it,
a `delivery_receipt` built by the server for exactly this moment. The receipt is
the handoff: it already carries the title, the executive summary the report
assembled, the integrity state, every item that needs attention, and the artifact
lines.

### Relay the receipt

Put `delivery_receipt.display_markdown` in front of the human unchanged. Add a
sentence of your own before it if the conversation needs one; do not rewrite,
reorder, shorten, or re-summarize what it contains. Do not summarize the findings
yourself — the server assembles the report from stored data, and a summary you
compose in its place drops the parts that are least comfortable to read: the
refusal flags, the unresolved citations, the preview watermark.

The receipt is a receipt, not a second copy of the report. It may preview a few
findings when labelled as a subset ("3 highest-severity of 27"); the full set
lives in the report JSON and in the rendered artifact. Never paste the whole
findings table into chat as if it were the deliverable.

### Artifacts

`artifacts[]` entries carry `format`, `sha256`, `render_id`, and `expires_at`
beside the download URL. Surface all of them. The URL is short-lived, so a link
pasted without its hash and expiry is unverifiable the moment it lapses, and the
hash is what lets anyone confirm later that the file they hold is the file the
run produced.

Three artifact states mean three different things, and the receipt distinguishes
them: no artifact because none was requested (`format=json`), an artifact ready,
and a render that failed. A failed render arrives as an attention item — say it
out loud. "Report ready" over a failed render is the one sentence the customer
cannot recover from.

### Attention items and integrity

Every entry in `attention_items` reaches the human. The list is uncapped on
purpose: a truncated refusal is the loss this receipt exists to prevent.

Integrity metrics carry their own computation status. A metric marked
`unsupported` means this report type does not measure it — say that, and do not
report it as zero. Zero is a measured clean result and reads as one.

If the receipt arrives with `status: "projection_error"`, tell the human the
handoff failed and hand them the typed report and the artifact links directly.
The report itself is intact in that case. Hiding the failure and improvising a
summary rebuilds the problem the receipt was built to solve.

### Afterwards

`next_actions` is server-derived from what the caller can actually do next. Offer
what it lists and nothing beyond it — an offer to render a PDF that the run
cannot produce wastes a turn and ends in a refusal.

Answer follow-up questions from the report JSON, which is the canonical machine
record of the run. Re-read it rather than recalling what you wrote earlier in the
conversation. If a question needs something the report does not contain, say so;
the answer is another run or another tool call, not recollection.
